# Final Project
This is a website that will allow businesses to create non-fungible and semi-fungible tokens, along with ERC 20 tokens, so that they can use them for their use cases.

Included is a webpage called "How to use", which will explain which items/what order you will want to use the generators. In addition, there is a "What's Next?" page to help businesses integrate these new tokens into their own smart contracts and actually make use of them.
